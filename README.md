# ChatGPT Auto Labeler Action

The ChatGPT Auto Labeler Action is a GitHub Action that automatically assigns labels to issues, discussions, and pull requests based on responses generated by ChatGPT. This action utilizes the power of ChatGPT to analyze the content and title of these artifacts and suggests suitable labels from the available labels.

## Usage
To use this action, you need to set up the necessary inputs and provide your ChatGPT API token.

## Inputs
- `openai-api-key` (required): API token for ChatGPT.
- `gh-token` (required): GitHub personal access token.
- `timeout` (optional): Timeout for ChatGPT API requests in seconds.
- `details` (optional): Additional details for label suggestions. For example: SBOM is not misconfig.

## Example Workflow
Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/auto-labeling.yaml`) with the following content:

```yaml
name: Auto Labeling

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened

jobs:
  auto-label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Auto Labeling with ChatGPT
        uses: nikpivkin/auto-label@latest
        with:
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          gh-token: ${{ secrets.MY_PERSONAL_GH_TOKEN }}

    # Add additional steps as needed
```

## Configuration
ChatGPT API Token: Obtain a ChatGPT API token from the [ChatGPT OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Workflow Trigger: Configure the workflow trigger as needed. The example above triggers the workflow when a new issue or pull request is opened.
