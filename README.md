# ChatGPT Auto Labeler Action

The ChatGPT Auto Labeler Action is a GitHub Action that automatically assigns labels to issues, discussions, and pull requests based on responses generated by ChatGPT. This action utilizes the power of ChatGPT to analyze the content and title of these artifacts and suggests suitable labels from the available labels.
